# Steganography
Part of a larger group project (Security Final)
 - This portion encrypts/decrypts any file into an image and back.
 - The image must be large enough to fit the file or else it won't be able to encrypt/decrypt it completely.
 - This would be useful for hiding small scripts into an image if you were an evil hacker trying to rule the world.
